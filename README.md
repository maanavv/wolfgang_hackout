# Varun - Coastal Threat Alert System

PROBLEM STATEMENT - 3 
The problem is to build a comprehensive early warning and alerting platform that collects data from physical sensors (e.g., tide gauges, weather stations), satellite feeds, and historical records. Using AI/ML, it should analyse trends and detect anomalies or patterns that indicate looming threatsâ€”such as rising sea levels, algal blooms, illegal dumping, or cyclonic activity. The system must disseminate actionable alerts via SMS, app notifications, and web dashboards to the appropriate authorities and potentially exposed communities.
